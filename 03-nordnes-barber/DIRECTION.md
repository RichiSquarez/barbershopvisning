Brief: Nordnes Barber — a small neighbourhood barbershop in Nordnes, fixed prices on a painted board, walk-in only, five chairs.

| --- | --- |
| Direction | The split stage |
| Hero | Menu column, sticky photograph |
| Type | Boska |
| Colour | Studio grey |
| Sections | list (Two-ended rows, narrow column) → about (Founder's letter) → faq (Answers as reading text) → contact (Address in display rows) |
| Motion | Slow crossfade |
| Photographs | the "Coast" set, as atmosphere |

This is the direction for this build. Adopt it. Do not blend it with the layout you would have made anyway,
and do not redraw because it is unfamiliar: unfamiliar is the point. Redraw a slot only when it conflicts
with a stated brand constraint or needs an asset that does not exist, and say why in your report.

The parts of this sheet were written separately and will disagree in small ways. Settle every disagreement in this order:
**house rules** (including type no smaller than 13px and body text of 16px or more) → **the direction** (the idea, the composition habits, where the
one accent goes) → **the type system and the palette** (which face does which job, the five size steps, which colour is the ground and where the
accent goes) → **the hero blueprint** → **the section blueprints**. Under each blueprint below, "Adjusted for this page" lists where it disagrees.
In practice: take geometry from blueprints (columns, proportions, what sits where) and take everything else from above them. Map every size a
blueprint names onto one of your five type steps instead of adding a sixth. Use one button shape, one corner radius and one pair of page margins on
the whole page, whatever individual blueprints say. If a blueprint names a kind of typeface (a light serif, a heavy grotesk), use the dealt face.

## 1. The idea
Half the screen never moves. One side is a fixed photograph (or object, or product view) that stays in place for the whole visit; the other side is a calm scrolling column with everything you need to read. The fixed half keeps the feeling present while the reader gets on with the facts, like sitting in the room while reading the menu. As sections pass, the fixed image may quietly change to the one that matches.

Before anything else, write one sentence in your notes: "On this page, <the subject's own material> becomes <the device>."
Fill the first blank from your inventory of what only this client has (its name and what it means, its street, its numbers, its
constraint), then put the nearest competitor in the sentence: if it still works, the idea is the category's, not the client's.
Then name the one live thing the visitor can do on the page (SKILL.md step 4).

## 2. Composition
Desktop: a two-column page, 50/50 or 45/55. One column is `position: sticky; top: 0; height: 100svh` and holds a single photograph filling it edge to edge, or the object centred on a flat field. The other column scrolls and holds all content in a single narrow measure (max 46ch) with comfortable padding (48–72px): name and one-line description first, then sections separated by generous space, then contact and footer. Headings in the scrolling column are modest (32–44px). The column grounds differ: photograph on one side, flat paper colour on the other, meeting at a clean vertical edge. On a phone the fixed half becomes a 60svh image at the top that stays sticky behind the first section, then releases.

## 3. Type — Boska
A high-contrast serif with pointed serifs and a lively italic, used roman and italic together at one size. Suits perfume, jewellery, lodges, weddings and other occasions for ceremony.

<link href="https://api.fontshare.com/v2/css?f[]=boska@400,401,500&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```
- Display: **Boska** — weight 400 · tracking -0.02em · leading 0.95 · roman capitals for the main words with lowercase italic for the connecting words at the same size, or sentence case throughout; centred lines work
- Text: **Boska** — 400 for body, 500 for emphasis · leading 1.5 · tracking 0.005em
```css
:root {
  --step-small: clamp(0.8125rem, 0.79rem + 0.1vw, 0.875rem);
  --step-body: clamp(1.0625rem, 1rem + 0.25vw, 1.1875rem);
  --step-lead: clamp(1.25rem, 1.1rem + 0.7vw, 1.625rem);
  --step-head: clamp(2rem, 1.3rem + 3.2vw, 4rem);
}
```
A text-first setting: a readable serif or a calm sans at 17–19px, with one display size for the name. Left-aligned throughout.
The direction decides sizes and how many of them; the type system decides how this face is set. Where the two give different tracking or leading, use the values of the type system: they are tuned to this face.
The display size itself comes from the hero blueprint below.

## 4. Colour — Studio grey
```css
:root {
  --bg: #a8a8aa;
  --surface: #b4b4b6;
  --ink: #0e0e0e;
  --muted: #3a3a3c;
  --accent: #1f5c49;
  --accent-ink: #ffffff;
  --field-1: #1b1b1c;  --field-1-ink: #ffffff;
}
```
One mid grey serves as both page and studio backdrop, so the photographed object seems to stand on the page itself; type is black and one black band comes late. Colour comes only from the product, and racing green is for the single button.
The paper colour of the reading column is chosen against the photograph: a tone taken from its shadows or its lightest area. One ink, optionally one accent ink for links and the action.

## 5. Imagery
**Use the images that belong to the project in every picture slot.** For slots they cannot fill, real pictures of the subject's world from the open collections come next (start with `node /Users/panygolf/.agents/skills/design-taste-frontend/scripts/assets.mjs "nordnes postcard"`, then "nordnes old map" and "neighbourhood barbershop", then queries from your inventory (its street, its materials, its trade's tools and history); credit them on the page), then the dealt photographs.

One excellent portrait-orientation photograph for the fixed half, plus three or four more that crossfade in as their sections arrive. Small inline photographs in the reading column are optional and should be few.

**Floor (the inspector checks it):** at least four real pictures on the page, usually six to twelve; SVG drawings do not count. One moving picture where an honest clip exists: `node <skill>/scripts/assets.mjs --video "<query>"`, used as a muted loop with a poster frame. Whatever this direction says about pictures, it is carried out with real ones.

Photographs dealt for this build, from the "Coast" set (sea, shoreline, cliffs, piers and beaches)
Order of preference for imagery: (1) the project's own photographs and product shots; (2) images you generate, if an image tool is
available; (3) real pictures of the subject's world found in the open collections (assets.mjs, downloaded and credited on the page);
(4) drawings of the subject in code; (5) these. They are real photographs (Unsplash licence, served by picsum.photos) of places, light and
texture. They are atmosphere, never a stand-in for a specific product, dish, person or interface. List the ones you use in your report so
they can be replaced.

The last two path numbers are width and height: request the exact crop you render (`/1200/1500` for a 4:5 portrait, `/2400/1350` for a hero) and
add `?grayscale` to desaturate. Use three to six of them, not all eight. Always set `width`, `height`, `alt` and `loading="lazy"` (not on the hero image).
Other sets that fit this brief: interior-and-table, city-day, fog-and-quiet, mountain — `node draw.mjs --photos <set>` prints one in full; `--photos list` shows all sets. Taking photographs from another set is your call and is not a redraw; keep them to one light and one treatment.

## 6. Hero — Menu column, sticky photograph
The viewport is two panels of equal width with a 12px gap between them and 12px outer margins, both with a 20px radius. Right panel: one photograph of the place filling it edge to edge (object-fit: cover), set to position: sticky; top: 12px; height: calc(100svh - 24px), so it stays put while the left side scrolls. A solid bar in the paper colour, 56px tall, lies across the photograph's bottom edge inside the panel and carries opening hours on the left and the address on the right at 15px. Left panel: a filled paper-colour sheet set like a menu card, everything centred. Its top row holds the wordmark, about 300px wide, in the centre with one text link either side. Below, at 34% of the height, the headline in a light serif at clamp(40px, 3.6vw, 56px) on two lines in the accent ink, max 18ch per line. Under it one sentence at 17px, max 40ch, then the single action as a solid rectangle in the accent ink. The lower quarter of the sheet is empty before the first section begins.

On a phone: The photograph comes first as a rounded panel 56svh tall on 12px margins, sticky at the top so the paper sheet slides up over its lower part. The hours bar stays on the photograph's bottom edge. The sheet holds the wordmark centred at 46% of the width, the headline at 9vw on two lines, the sentence and a full-width action.
Headline: A warm 3-6 word line in a light serif, at most 34 characters, centred on two lines.

Adjusted for this page:
- It sets text at 12px: use your small step (13px or more) instead.
- It names its own corners: use the one radius of this page (square unless the direction says otherwise) and one button shape.
- It names a kind of typeface: use the dealt faces (display Boska, text Boska) and their settings; capitals only where the type system sets them.

## 7. Sections, in order
Each is a composition to rebuild with this project's content. Keep the geometry; change the subject. Re-order or drop a
section when the argument of the page needs it (see references/copy.md), never to fall back to a card grid.

### 1. list — Two-ended rows, narrow column (list)
A list in one narrow column, 520px wide, starting at 22% of the viewport width or centred. Every row is 34–38px tall with no box and nothing drawn between rows. Each row has two ends: at the left, a 16px round image (a face, a logo, a colour dot) followed after 8px by the name at 15–16px in full ink; at the far right of the column, a short value at 13px in the soft ink (a date, a price, a domain, an opening time) with tabular figures. Entries that need a sentence run to two lines at the left, and the value aligns with the first line. Groups are separated by 40px of space and begin with one plain word in the soft ink at the same size. A heading of two to four words at 24–28px in medium weight sits 32px above the first row. Holds 10–40 rows.
On a phone: The column fills the width with 20px margins. Rows are 44px tall for touch; the left image stays 16px. Long values wrap beneath the name at 13px, left-aligned with it, and the row grows. Group spacing is 32px.

### 2. about — Founder's letter (stack)
A letter in a centred column 520px wide with at least 160px of empty ground above and below. At the column's top-left, a round portrait 44px across. 28px below it, four or five short paragraphs at 16–17px with leading 1.55, each two to four lines and separated by one blank line, written in the first person. No heading. The sign-off is the writer's name at 22px in the text face's italic, with the role at 14px in the soft ink beneath it. One phrase in the letter may carry a flat marker-colour background. Variant for a page built as an object: the letter sits on a filled paper-colour sheet 640px wide with 60px padding on a contrasting ground, square corners, its bottom edge cut into small scallops with `clip-path`, and below a row of 5px round dots a tear-off strip 72px tall that carries the email address.
On a phone: The column takes the full width with 24px margins; text at 16px, portrait 40px. In the sheet variant the sheet spans edge to edge with 24px padding and keeps its shaped bottom edge; the tear-off strip stacks the email above a full-width button.

Adjusted for this page:
- It names a kind of typeface: use the dealt faces (display Boska, text Boska) and their settings; capitals only where the type system sets them.

### 3. faq — Answers as reading text (grid)
The questions and answers are set as continuous reading text, like the notes at the back of a programme. A heading of two or three words at 28–32px sits in columns 1–3, top-aligned. Columns 5–12 hold the text in two columns (`columns: 2; column-gap: 56px`), each about 36ch wide, at 16–17px with leading 1.55. Each item is one paragraph: the question is the opening run-in, set in the medium weight in the full ink and ending with its question mark, and the answer continues on the same line in the regular weight. Paragraphs are separated by 20px and carry `break-inside: avoid` so none splits across columns. No toggles, no icons, no boxes. Eight to fourteen items fit on one screen, which is the point: everything is answered at a glance. Where the page's reading column is narrow, use one column.
On a phone: One column at 16px with 20px margins. The heading leads at 24px. Each paragraph keeps its run-in question in the medium weight, with 18px between paragraphs. The section may run to two screens; do not collapse it into an accordion.

### 4. contact — Address in display rows (list)
The contact block is a stack of five full-width rows, every one set at the same size, clamp(44px, 6vw, 88px), regular weight, left-aligned with a 20px inset and leading 1.0: the building or venue name, the street, the city with postcode, the opening hours as one compact line, the phone number. Each row is about 150px tall with the text sitting in its lower third; rows are told apart by alternating two flat tones of the section colour as full-width bands, or by 28px of space alone. A sixth row holds a one-word greeting at the same size followed, 24px to its right and centred on the x-height, by a solid round button 0.9em across with an arrow, which opens the email or booking link. Street and phone rows are links (map, call). No heading and no form. Optionally, one small round photograph sits at the right end of the first row.
On a phone: Rows at 9.6vw with 16px insets, about 84px tall; the hours break onto two rows (days, then times). The greeting row becomes a full-width band in the accent colour with the round arrow button at its right end, 56px across.

## 8. Motion — Slow crossfade
The principal photograph quietly changes: three or four images of the same framing crossfade over about 1.6 seconds, holding five to six seconds each, or the fixed image changes when its matching section arrives. It should feel like light shifting in a room. Pause when the tab is hidden; under reduced motion show only the first image.
This is the signature move, the one loud moment. Around it the page still needs the rest of the motion layer (SKILL.md step 9): an entrance for the parts of every section, feedback on every control, and one moving picture. The inspector fails a page that barely moves. Recipes: references/motion.md.

## 10. Where the richness comes from
A full-height photograph always in view, against a quiet, well-set column of text.

## 11. How this direction goes wrong
The reading column must be genuinely well typeset, since it is half the page. Do not put cards or grids in it. Check that the fixed image crops well at short viewport heights. In blind tests the commonest complaint was monotony: several screens of the same split with only the text changing. Change what the reading half holds from section to section (a list, a large figure, a table, a full-colour panel, a drawing) and let at least one section break the split and run full width.

## 12. Real references
Studied sites that work this way. Take the principle, never the specifics: no names, copy, images or signature assets of theirs.
- **Rafael Derolez** (One Page Love, studied score 7.3) `opl-rafael-derolez-2026`
  Idea: A portfolio as a phone carousel: a fixed text rail on the left narrates whichever phone-shaped screen is centred on the right.
  Hero: Dark charcoal page split by a vertical hairline at 30% width. Left rail: a 55px header row with name, slash and current section as a breadcrumb in 16px sans, plus a small cobalt ticket-shaped hire button with a perforated divider and arrow; below a hairline, four short paragraphs of 16px grey text with white links, top-aligned, leaving the lower 40% of the rail empty. Right 70%: three phone-proportioned frames with large rounded corners in a row; the centre one upright, full brightness and about 680px tall, the outer two smaller, dimmed and rotated in perspective toward the centre.
  Worth taking: Use a breadcrumb (name / current item) as the only heading and update its last word as the content changes.
- **Le Petit Bleu** (One Page Love, studied score 7.8) `opl-le-petit-bleu`
  Idea: The cafe's teal-and-white stripes become the whole system: one teal ink on cream, everything boxed in thin double outlines like printed menu cards, beside a permanently visible photo of the room.
  Hero: Viewport split 50/50 with 12px gaps. Left: a cream panel with a thin pale-teal outline and rounded corners. Inside, a second outlined box is the nav bar: two-line hamburger left, teal brush-script logo about 300px wide centred, a caps order link right. Below, a two-line light serif headline at about 3.5vw, centred, in teal, then two centred stacks, each a bold caps label, a serif line and a solid teal button wrapped in a second thin outline. Right: a full-height rounded photo of a striped booth, with an outlined hours bar across its top, three slide dots bottom-left and a white address card bottom-right.
  Worth taking: Print everything in one brand ink on cream, including body text, rules and buttons, and let photographs supply the other colours.
- **Tengile Malamala Collection** (Awwwards Site of the Day, studied score 7.6) `aww-tengile-malamala-collection`
  Idea: Let the land and animals carry everything: one staggered hairline-serif headline over aerial footage, then cream pages of olive-green serif text with photographs placed at uneven sizes.
  Hero: Aerial river footage fills the viewport, slightly darkened. Three small white caps items sit on the top edge: an enquiry link hard left, a stacked three-line wordmark centred, 'menu' hard right. The headline is two words on two lines in thin serif capitals about 8.3vw tall: the first line starts 10% from the left, the second is indented to 40% and ends near 90%, so the pair steps diagonally across the middle third. Below, starting at the 50% line, a three-line serif sentence at about 20px and a small white square-cornered button with a separate arrow square beside it. The lower third is left to the water.
  Worth taking: Stagger a two-line headline: first line from the left margin, second indented by 30% so the pair steps diagonally across the image.
Full notes on any of them: `node draw.mjs --site <id>`.

## Always
Headlines two lines or fewer at every width. No eyebrow labels, no monospace, no 01/02/03, no thin rules, no gradients, no shadows at rest,
no cream-and-terracotta, no violet. The frame: one h1 on the first screen that says what this is, equal outer margins, no
section huddled on one side with the other half empty, no blank stretch over half a screen, a heading on every section.
`inspect.mjs` measures all of it.
